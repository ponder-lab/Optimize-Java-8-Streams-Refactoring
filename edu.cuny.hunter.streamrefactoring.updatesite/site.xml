      The Java 8 Stream API sets forth a promising new programming model that incorporates functional-like, MapReduce-style features into a mainstream programming language. However, using streams efficiently may involve subtle considerations.

This tool consists of automated refactoring research prototype plug-ins for Eclipse that assists developers in writing optimal stream client code in a semantics-preserving fashion. Refactoring preconditions and transformations for automatically determining when it is safe and possibly advantageous to convert a sequential stream to parallel and improve upon already parallel streams are included. The approach utilizes both WALA and SAFE.
