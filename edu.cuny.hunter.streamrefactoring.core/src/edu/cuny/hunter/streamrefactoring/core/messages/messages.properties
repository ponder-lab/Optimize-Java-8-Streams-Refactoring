DeclaringTypeContainsSubtype=Declaring type ''{0}'' contains subtypes.
SourceMethodOverridesMethod=Source method ''{0}'' overrides a method, which would result in a "class wins" rule, possibly altering virtual method dispatch semantics.

SourceMethodProvidesImplementationsForMultipleMethods=Source method ''{0}'' provides an implementation for a method in another interface ''{1}''. Migrating it would result in a compilation error as either a conflict would be caused or multiple methods would be inherited.
MethodContainsQualifiedThisExpression=Method ''{0}'' has a declaring type that is a member and contains a qualified this expression that would not be valid in an interface.
